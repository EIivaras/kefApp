          Hear ye, hear ye! The seventeenth annual Raven's Rumble is due to commence on the 12th of January, 2018.
          Participants will be split into teams of two at random, fighting for a prize of one thousand gold pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tourney will be double elimination, with a time limit of thirty minutes. If one member of a team is knocked to the ground,
          flat on their back, their team loses. If this does not happen in the thirty minute period assigned to the fight, the winner will
          be decided by whichever team answers a question about Norn legends and history.

          ((OOC Aside: We are looking for people who want to play npc participants in this upcoming tournament, for both the 12th of January
          and potentially the 19th of January depending on how far their teams get. Please message Elivaras or Hapless Peasant on discord,
          or if you're already in the #story-arc-participant channel, ask there.))
